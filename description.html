        <p>Valorant is a 2020 first-person tactical hero shooter video game developed and published by Riot Games.[3] 
        A free-to-play game, Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, 
        spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving. Development started in 2014 and was teased under the codename Project A in 2019; 
        the game was released on June 2, 2020 for Windows. It was ported to the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 in June 2024, 
        albeit without crossplay between PC and console clients.
